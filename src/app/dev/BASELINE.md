## Runner Integrity Check

If duplicate check IDs are detected, the system will fail fast with:

```
Passed: 0 | Failed: 1

✗ Runner integrity: duplicate check ids detected
  Error: Duplicate ids: [comma-separated list of duplicate ids]
```

No other checks will execute when duplicates are detected.

## Usage

When making changes to any utility or component:

1. Run the self-checks
2. Compare output against this baseline
3. If check count changes, update this document
4. If any checks fail unexpectedly, investigate before committing
