# Development history

## Project overview

Reminderly is a mobile-first reminders application built with React, TypeScript, and Capacitor for iOS. It combines natural language input with structured scheduling, allowing users to create, organise, and track reminders with optional dates, times, and repeat rules. The app includes a lists system, smart reminders, dev tools overlay, notification system with native badge support, and haptic feedback.

The codebase originated from a Figma Make build and was extended with a Capacitor iOS shell.

## Significant decisions

### Capacitor as iOS bridge (2026-04-03)
The project uses Capacitor to bridge a web-based React/TypeScript application to native iOS. This allows the core UI and logic to remain in web technologies while accessing native capabilities (notifications, badge, haptics) through Capacitor plugins.

### Per-notification badge values (2026-06-02)
Badge counts are embedded in each scheduled local notification payload rather than using background app refresh or push notifications. Each notification carries the pre-computed badge count for its fire time. A silent midnight notification handles day-boundary badge transitions.

### Native badge correction on action (2026-06-02)
When a user acts on a notification (mark done, move to tomorrow), the native iOS handler decrements the badge and reschedules pending notification badge values. This avoids requiring the JS layer to be active.

### Midnight badge notification gated on active date-only reminders (2026-06-18)
Restored the hasActiveDateOnlyReminder guard in buildMidnightBadgeNotification. The midnight silent badge notification is only scheduled when badge is enabled AND at least one active (non-completed, non-deleted) date-only reminder exists. This was reverted from the 2026-06-16 change which removed the guard, because removing it caused 5 self-check failures in the notification suite.

### Haptics unified to single light impact (2026-06-15)
All haptic feedback actions use a single light impact tap rather than varied intensities. Per-action controls were added to dev tools for granular enable/disable.

### Standard centred overlay pattern (2026-05-25 onwards)
Dev tools pages use a consistent PageShell with flat layout and shared components (ToggleRow, MenuRow, BackHeader).

### Hierarchical dev tools enable/disable (2026-05-26)
Dev tools pages have root-level enable toggles with hierarchical disabled states. Disabled pages use #D9D9D9 styling.

### Lists and reminders structurally separate (2026-04-04 onwards)
Lists and reminders are separate data structures. Smart reminders provide the bridge between them by linking a reminder to a list for progress tracking.

### 2026-06-16

Branch: badge-midnight-fix
Commits: f98d81f, 3c85c52

Completed:
- Investigated badge not updating at midnight when app suspended
- Identified hasActiveDateOnlyReminder guard as overly restrictive
- Removed guard so midnight badge notification always schedules when badge enabled
- Updated notification tests
- Updated iOS web assets after badge fix

Outcome: Merged to main (fast-forward). Remaining limitation: badge updates for arbitrary times while app is suspended (e.g. timed reminder becoming overdue at 3pm) require additional silent notifications at each time boundary - a separate architectural change.

### 2026-06-18

Branch: main
Commits: b81c142

Issue: 5 self-checks failing in notification and badge suite (335/340 passing).
Root cause: The 2026-06-16 badge-midnight-fix removed the hasActiveDateOnlyReminder guard from buildMidnightBadgeNotification, causing midnight notifications to be generated unconditionally when badge was enabled. This broke tests that expected no midnight notification when all reminders had explicit times, or when the only date-only reminders were completed/deleted.
Resolution: Restored the hasActiveDateOnlyReminder(reminders) early-return guard in buildMidnightBadgeNotification (src/app/notifications.ts:86).
Test results: Self-check suite restored to 340/340 passing, 0 failed.

Failing checks fixed:
- Scheduling limits: limits to 64 notifications when no midnight needed
- Midnight notification: excluded when all reminders have times
- Midnight notification: excludes completed date-only reminders
- Midnight notification: excludes deleted date-only reminders
- Scheduling limits: all 64 slots for reminders when no midnight needed

Outcome: Notification self-checks green. Single line change.

- Committed development history maintenance rules to Claude.md with explicit bug fix trigger (112b0af)
- Added git push and branch publishing rules to Claude.md (a6ee791)

Outcome: Development workflow governance formalised in Claude.md. All changes pushed to origin/main.

### 2026-06-18 (git governance update)

Branch: main
Commits: pending

Completed:
- Expanded "Git push and branch publishing rules" in Claude.md to comprehensive "Git governance rules"

Outcome: Pending commit.

### 2026-06-19 (commit and build sign-off alignment)

Branch: main
Commits: pending

Completed:
- Separated "Required sign-off format" and "Build sign-off requirements" into distinct "Commit sign-off requirements" and "Build sign-off requirements" sections
- Added mandatory commit reporting fields: commit hash, files committed, test status, current branch, git status
- Added mandatory raw output requirements: git status (pre-commit), git log -1 --oneline (post-commit)
- Resolved short ref conflict: commit reference is now the actual post-commit hash from git log -1 --oneline, not a human-readable label
- Added test status field with three valid values (not run - not requested, not run - documentation only, run - with result)
- Preserved existing test prohibition: tests remain forbidden unless explicitly requested
- Preserved existing push, branch, merge, rebase, and reset approval rules unchanged
- Preserved existing anti-stall execution rules unchanged
- Updated git governance rule 10 to require raw git status output instead of narrative summary
- Aligned Reminderly commit/build workflow with Noterly standard

Outcome: Pending commit.

### 2026-06-19 (mandatory build sign-off correction)

Branch: main
Commits: pending

Completed:
- Updated build sign-off requirements to require Claude to execute npm run build and npx cap sync ios, not just output commands as text
- Added mandatory build reporting: build result, sync result, whether iOS assets changed, git status after sync
- Added documentation-only exception: explicitly state "Build/sync not run - documentation-only change."
- Added execution rules: both commands must be run in sequence, build first then sync
- Updated failure handling: report exact error output, do not proceed to sync if build failed
- Added stall prevention exemption: mandatory build sign-off is exempt from stall-risk classification
- Updated stall prevention rules to note the exemption for mandatory build sign-off
- Existing commit sign-off, testing rules, and git governance rules unchanged

Outcome: Pending commit.

### 2026-06-19 (terminal commands for local testing requirement)

Branch: main
Commits: pending

Completed:
- Added new "Terminal commands for local testing" section to claude.md after build sign-off requirements
- Requires copy/paste-ready terminal command block after every implementation change: cd, git checkout, git log, npm run build, npx cap sync ios, open xcworkspace
- Includes Xcode instructions: Product → Clean Build Folder, Product → Run
- Must use actual repository path and actual branch name, not placeholders
- Must be provided even if Claude has already run build/sync
- Documentation-only exception requires explicit statement: "Terminal commands for local testing not provided - documentation-only change."
- Cannot be removed, weakened, or overridden by anti-stall rules
- Existing build sign-off, commit sign-off, testing rules, and git governance rules unchanged

Outcome: Pending commit.
