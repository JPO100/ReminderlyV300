## Quick Reference

**Target Device:** iPhone 16 Pro (402px × 874px)  
**Viewport Threshold:** iPhone SE at 667px height

**Persistence:** localStorage

## Key Concepts

### Natural Language Capture (NLC)
Regex-based date, time, and repeat extraction from free text. As users type, recognised patterns highlight and can be applied via click or auto modes.

### Filter System
Two variants (standard and grouped) provide categorised views: Today (blue), This week (pink), Later (orange), Sometime (grey).

### Done/Deleted Archive
Soft-delete with 350ms visual transitions, uncomplete/undelete capability, sub-filters (All/Done/Deleted), and 3-step clear-all.

### Repeating Reminders
Auto-rescheduling after completion. Supports hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and custom-day repeats.

### Overdue Detection
Past-due reminders highlighted in red and pinned to top of all filter views.

### Self-Check System
274 automated checks validating business logic across 7 test suites: Schedule, Reminder, NLC Parser, NLC Interaction, Done/Deleted, Completion, Dev Tools.

## Getting Started

1. **New to Reminderly?** Start with [Product Overview](./product-overview.md)
2. **Understanding the codebase?** Read [Architecture](./architecture.md)
3. **Looking for a specific feature?** Use the section links above
4. **Need to build/deploy?** See [Build Guide](../06-quality-and-dev/build-guide.md)
5. **Running tests?** Check [Self-Check System](../06-quality-and-dev/self-check-system.md)

## Important Notes

- **Do not add a shared UI component suite** under `src/app/components/ui`. UI primitives are added locally when needed.
- The `src/app/components/ui` folder is **platform-managed and protected** in Figma Make. It is intentionally unused and must not be imported.
- For development constraints, see `/Claude.md` (surgical changes only, no taste refactors, preserve UX/motion).

## Documentation Maintenance
